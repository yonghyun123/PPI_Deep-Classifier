Making Classifier dividing amino acid toxic or non-toxin proteins.
Using NVidia CUDA library and GTX 1080 based on Linux Ubuntu 16.04.
Variable Deep Learning Model was used as switching optimizer, hidden layer, cost function etc.
We were training three classifier each datasets.
We develped standard model that consist of cross-entropy function, sigmoid, 3 number of hidden layer, non-initializer.
